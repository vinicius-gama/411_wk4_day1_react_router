## Setup

Clone this repo and run `npm i` and then `npm start`

## Project Instructions

* Two components have already been created for you, Home & About.

* Look for the Router.js file under the `src` folder. This file is basically empty besides a couple imports. You need to create a functional component called `Router` in this file. You will return a `Routes` wrapper container that wraps two individual `Route`'s. The two `Route`'s should be the following:
    * "/" -> Home
    * "/about" -> About

* Now we are going to take this Router and import it into `App.js`. Place it right underneath the Navigation component. You will need to import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` and use it to wrap both the Navigation and the Router components.

* If you were successful you should see a homepage with a lot of different car details on it. You should also be able to add "/about" to the end of the url to see the about page. Typing this paths in the browser will soon get tiring so let's add them to the Navigation component. There are two commented areas for you to add links. Create one Link to the Home page and one to the About page. If you forget how to do that, reference the documentation [here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/components/link).

* Next we want to fill out the `Car` component in `src/Car.js` but first we will need to be able to see it and `Link` to it. Inside of `Router.js` import the "Car" component and create a route for it. The path should be able to accept an id for the specific car as well. For example: "/car/:id".

* Once that is complete, go to the `Home` component and look for the comment regarding the "a tag". Change that to a `Link` component and have the "to" property be: `/car/${car.id}`. You can leave the text, "See More Details" the same. Notice how you are routed to the "Car" component when you click on the Link. Try clicking on different cars, do you notice that the id is different each time?

* Now that we can navigate to the `Car` component we want to fill out this page so that it looks nice and provides details about the specific car we passed in. To get the specific car we need to access the "id" property from the path. We can do that by accessing it using a hook from `"react-router-dom"`. The `useParams` hook return an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic params from the current URL that were matched by the `Route`'s path. At the top level, make sure to `import { useParams } from "react-router-dom"`. Once we have that hook being imported, inside of our component, but before the return, we want to instantiate `useParams()` and destructure the object it returns. It will look like this: `const {id} = useParams()`. Now that we have destructured the object that `useParams` returns, we now have access to the key/value by using the `id` variable. Check out the docs for `useParams` [here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/hooks/use-params).

* Note that if you would have called the parameter (id) something different in the router, say "carId", then that would change how we access it here as well `const {carId} = useParams()`. Also, if you feel more comfortable, instead of destructuring, we can simply access our dynamic values with this same line: `const {id} = useParams()`. 

* Now that we have the specific id we need to find the car in the list that matches that id. You should know how to find items in an array by now so go ahead and find the specific car. Hint: the cars are in the "cars" variable at the top of the file.

* Create the `Car` component so that it looks like the image below. To do that, import the MUI components as specified at the top of the file. You will use the [MUI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) to figure out how to style this page.
